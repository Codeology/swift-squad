"""
This starter code will grab six prominent colors from an image and return them,
along with a histogram that might (need to research) contain information about
color frequencies relative to one another. 

Where to go from here:
Consider removing lightest / darkest colors
Address contrast/color similarity/other palette aesthetics 
Create metric to measure color frequencies
Play with color contrast
Right now we have to deal with the discrepancy of RGB/BGR values in images. We may want to consider
    converting to hex values before sending back to the frontend 
Create return value format (JSON structure) for the frontend 
Last step: convert to a format that allows processing to be executed with an http request!
- Remember we might want to let the user select the number of colors they want 

Stretch goal: storage (might also be a frontend thing)
