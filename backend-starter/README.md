## Classifying Pixel Colors
This is the backend idea we played with over the summer, and we want to give a chance to try it!
Going forward, we could preserve some or all of its functionality, or we could throw it
out altogether and come up with something else for our app to do!

Things to install: 
- `pip install cv2`
- `pip install pandas`
- `pip install sklearn`
- `pip install numpy` 

To run, `python3 classify.py` 
NOTE: this program takes a *while*. When the first image pops up,
press any key to continue with the program. When the result image pops up, press 
any key to end the program and close both windows.
