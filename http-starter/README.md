## Setting up HTTP Requests
Our API is made from Python and the Flask-RESTful framework, which allows us to define API routes we hit from the frontend.
This starter program models simple requests with both JSON and file components.. 
1. Install: `pip install flask` `pip install flask_restful`
2. Run! `python3 main.py`

Once running, the program will log the local host where it's running in the terminal. Any requests 
you send to that address can now hit your API if an appropriate route exists!
